# Laura's software engineering resume

## How to use
This template uses Latex, a programming language for creating formatted documents. You'll want a Latex compiler so you can check how your resume builds as you work on it. I use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). Download this project (Code => Download ZIP) and upload the entire folder to Overleaf. 

In [main.tex](https://github.com/laurachapman/resume-2022/main.tex), replace all my info with your info. You can also change the text colors- find the section with `Change the colours if you want to`. 

When you are done, download it as a PDF. 

If you have a personal website, you can display your resume super easily ([see mine](https://laurachapman.github.io/resume.html): 
```
<div style="text-align: center; margin: auto">
    <iframe src="LauraResume2021.pdf" width="80%" height="700px">
    </iframe>
</div>
```

## Why this template?
When I did my most recent job search in late spring 2021, I did a ton of research on tech resume formats, because I had a suspicion that the resume template I was using from my college's career office might be outdated ([they actually haven't updated the templates since 2013](https://ocs.fas.harvard.edu/files/ocs/files/seas_junior20-21.pdf?m=1598219780)). 

I knew I wanted to use Latex for my resume so it would be codeable and I'd be able to adjust everything to my liking. I found that a ton of people on resume sharing forums were using this AltaCV template, which uses colored accents and makes efficient use of space on the page. You can read more about the template in the [AltaCV README](https://github.com/laurachapman/resume-2022/ALTACV.md).

I filled in my info and then had my resume reviewed by a career counselor at Harvard. He caught a couple typos and had some feedback on the formatting, most notably advising me against the two-column layout in the original template. 

This resume did very well for me. I got many job interviews and ultimately landed at Google. I've since updated my resume to include my current job but other than that it is pretty much the same as when I applied.

It is definitely a worthy investment to take some time at the beginning of a job search to revamp and polish your resume, and be sure that you have someone look it over for mistakes. 

## Notes on personal projects
The personal projects section is an underrated part of a software engineering resume, especially for early career software engineers with limited job experience. Even if you think your side tinkering is lame, consider putting a few non-work projects on your resume. I don't think having side projects is a prerequisite for most SWE jobs, but for the most competitive jobs it'll help you stand out. Occasionally interviewers will be more interested in hearing about these projects than your paid work. 

My project [Solving MTV's Are You the One with Functional Scala](https://laura-chapman.medium.com/solving-mtvs-are-you-the-one-with-functional-scala-c3815ec361a) was by far the project that my interviewers were the most interested in. If you can do something code-y with something non-technical that you are interested in, those are the best side projects.
